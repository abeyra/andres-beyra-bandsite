        <p class="article__quote">“We push each other to be the best. It’s not uncommon for one of us to say ‘this needs to be better, back to the
            drawing board'”</p>

        <h3 class="article__sub-title">The Bees Knees</h3>
        <p class="article__copy">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating
        from San Francisco, California. The band
        consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
        Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist
        Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The
        band achieved its first commercial success as
        an unsigned act, drawing attention from
        manager Cam Adams. Having worked with
        other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room,
        One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was
        confident the band could succeed even further,
        pushing them to sign with Magenta Records.</p>

        <p class="article__copy">From there, the band has soared, gaining
        international recognition and ranking in the
        top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans
        immediately fell in love with the band’s original
        and organic attitude, solidifying their place as
        one of the hottest and fastest up and coming
        acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to
        themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
        their candid and authentic performances on
        stage. Looking forward to touring in the future,
        The Bees Knees are currently recording their
        second studio album, looking to be released in
        late 2021.</p>
